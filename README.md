# SUPERHET COFFEE — Website

A bold, stylish, and minimal one-page site for SUPERHET COFFEE.

## What's included
- `index.html` — semantic, SEO-friendly markup
- `styles/styles.css` — variables, responsive, and accessible styles
- `js/script.js` — small JS for nav and reveal animations
- `images/` — placeholder folder for your photography

## How to preview
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a simple server).
2. Replace images in `images/` with your own high-resolution photos for best results.

## Quick notes & next steps
- Replace the Instagram link (`https://instagram.com/superhetcoffee`) with the shop's real handle.
- Add real product photos for the hero and gallery (Instagram-style squares).
- Optimize and compress images for fast load times (WebP recommended).
- To deploy: push to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for a fast static site.

## Accessibility & SEO
- Uses semantic headings and alt text on images.
- High contrast palette and keyboard-friendly navigation.

If you'd like, I can add a PDF menu, printable takeaway mat, or set this up for automatic deployment. 🚀# SUPERHET-COFFEE-Demo
